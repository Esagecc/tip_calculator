# Frontend Mentor - Tip calculator app

![Design preview for the Tip calculator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

Want some support on the challenge? [Join our Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack) and ask questions in the **#help** channel.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

You can host your site using one of these solutions or any of our other trusted providers. [Read more about our recommended and trusted hosts](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe).

## Create a custom `README.md`

We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one. We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code.

The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you like.

Once you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`. That will make it show up as your repository's README file.

## Submitting your solution

Submit your solution on the platform for the rest of the community to see. Follow our ["Complete guide to submitting solutions"](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/a-complete-guide-to-submitting-solutions-on-frontend-mentor-ac6384162248) for tips on how to do this.

Remember, if you're looking for feedback on your solution, be sure to ask questions when submitting it. The more specific and detailed you are with your questions, the higher the chance you'll get valuable feedback from the community.

## Sharing your solution

There are multiple places you can share your solution:

1. Share your solution page in the **#finished-projects** channel of the [Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack). 
2. Tweet [@frontendmentor](https://twitter.com/frontendmentor) and mention **@frontendmentor**, including the repo and live URLs in the tweet. We'd love to take a look at what you've built and help share it around.
3. Share your solution on other social channels like LinkedIn.
4. Blog about your experience building your project. Writing about your workflow, technical choices, and talking through your code is a brilliant way to reinforce what you've learned. Great platforms to write on are [dev.to](https://dev.to/), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/), and [CodeNewbie](https://community.codenewbie.org/).

We provide templates to help you share your solution once you've submitted it on the platform. Please do edit them and include specific questions when you're looking for feedback. 

The more specific you are with your questions the more likely it is that another member of the community will give you feedback.

## Got feedback for us?

We love receiving feedback! We're always looking to improve our challenges and our platform. So if you have anything you'd like to mention, please email hi[at]frontendmentor[dot]io.

This challenge is completely free. Please share it with anyone who will find it useful for practice.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I wanted to write as much of the Javascript that I could understand from my perspective. It was a tough challenge to figure out with googling and finding different resources. I am proud that I completed most of the coding from my studying.

I looked for various example of this project. But many appear confusing and there is no video with dialogue to explain the code being use. 

I did have to learn how to use CSS grid to complete the buttons for the percentage and be web responsive. I used the following CSS generator to complete the task. https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/ Great resource.

My first JS challenge was getting the input value from the bill and people input box. I learned to add Event Listener and function just to console.log the value I type in. I was needed to learn how to make input box type number from the right. 

Then I needed to figure out how to get the number value from the custom button. I needed to switch the custom button to an input field. Then I again added a event listener and function to console log the value I put in. 

I learned that using the event listener to add 'input' to make an automatically event to make the tip work. 

Next I tried to find out how to get the button percentage to work. I looked at various CodePen examples and other Github example. They were all very confusing and I did not grasp how to code it to make it work. This was the biggest challenge yet. Then I saw this code pen and I used their coding to add a function to accept the value. I first only coded the 5% and then make sure that I was able to get the bill amount. It worked after testing it with console log. Here the code pen: https://codepen.io/KeithleySLHS/pen/bqRyao. I like it because it did not have to much lines of code. 
Then I coded how to add the divide bill and tip amount and sucess. 

Then I added the inner Text to the bottom of the page.

I did have to learn how to add $ to the bottom inner text and I used this example to make it work. https://github.com/Esagecc/tip_calculator/blob/main/index.html

Then adding the error message was tricky. For some reason, I could not make it work the style.display or visibility in the function. So I would test the style.background into red if it could function could detec the bill being more than 0 and the people's input was empty. Once it detec both input box then I added the error message. 

At last I worked on the reset button. I was trying to think how to reset the bottom box to 0 and made that work with reset button. But then I started thinking why not just refresh the page to reset all the input boxes and texts. And it worked. 

I am so proud with this assignment that I would added to my website portfolio.

Please hire me. I am capable of figuring out this assignment on my own and I am very resourceful with google. 

Thank you.
