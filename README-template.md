### What I learned

I wanted to write as much of the Javascript that I could understand from my perspective. It was a tough challenge to figure out with googling and finding different resources. I am proud that I completed most of the coding from my studying.

I looked for various example of this project. But many appear confusing and there is no video with dialogue to explain the code being use. 

I did have to learn how to use CSS grid to complete the buttons for the percentage and be web responsive. I used the following CSS generator to complete the task. https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/ Great resource.

My first JS challenge was getting the input value from the bill and people input box. I learned to add Event Listener and function just to console.log the value I type in. I was needed to learn how to make input box type number from the right. 

Then I needed to figure out how to get the number value from the custom button. I needed to switch the custom button to an input field. Then I again added a event listener and function to console log the value I put in. 

I learned that using the event listener to add 'input' to make an automatically event to make the tip work. 

Next I tried to find out how to get the button percentage to work. I looked at various CodePen examples and other Github example. They were all very confusing and I did not grasp how to code it to make it work. This was the biggest challenge yet. Then I saw this code pen and I used their coding to add a function to accept the value. I first only coded the 5% and then make sure that I was able to get the bill amount. It worked after testing it with console log. Here the code pen: https://codepen.io/KeithleySLHS/pen/bqRyao. I like it because it did not have to much lines of code. 
Then I coded how to add the divide bill and tip amount and sucess. 

Then I added the inner Text to the bottom of the page.

I did have to learn how to add $ to the bottom inner text and I used this example to make it work. https://github.com/Esagecc/tip_calculator/blob/main/index.html

Then adding the error message was tricky. For some reason, I could not make it work the style.display or visibility in the function. So I would test the style.background into red if it could function could detec the bill being more than 0 and the people's input was empty. Once it detec both input box then I added the error message. 

At last I worked on the reset button. I was trying to think how to reset the bottom box to 0 and made that work with reset button. But then I started thinking why not just refresh the page to reset all the input boxes and texts. And it worked. 

I am so proud with this assignment that I would added to my website portfolio.

Please hire me. I am capable of figuring out this assignment on my own and I am very resourceful with google. 

Thank you.
